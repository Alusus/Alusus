# ALUSUS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Alusus is designed to be a language for everything by making language features hot-pluggable, and on a per-project basis (rather than per-environment), which allows the language to:
* Expand vertically to cover low level features like those in C++ as well as high level features like those found in languages like Python or Ruby.
* Expand horizonatally to cover all aspects of programming which saves the user having to use more than one language.
* Allow anyone to enhance the language in a decentralized way, which allows users to develop new programming techniques or paradigms without having to start from scratch with a new language.

Imagine being able to write your client side code, server side code, DB access code, GPU shaders, etc, all in one language. Imagine switching between programming paradigms becomes a matter of picking up a different library rather than a different language. Imagine writing your program in a high level language while still being able to switch to low level for performance critical components. Alusus is designed to make all that possible.
