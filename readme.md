# ALUSUS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE [[عربي]](readme.ar.md)

Alusus is designed to be a language for everything by making language features hot-plugable, and on a per-project basis
 (rather than per-environment), which allows the language to:
* Expand vertically to cover low level features like those in C++ as well as high level features like those found in
languages like Python or Ruby.
* Expand horizontally to cover all aspects of programming which saves the user having to use more than one language.
* Allow anyone to enhance the language in a decentralized way, which allows users to develop new programming techniques
or paradigms without having to start from scratch with a new language.

Imagine being able to write your client side code, server side code, DB access code, GPU shaders, etc, all in one
language. Imagine switching between programming paradigms becomes a matter of picking up a different library rather than
a different language. Imagine writing your program in a high level language while still being able to switch to low
level for performance critical components. The goal of Alusus is to eventually make all that possible, but development
is still in an early stage, and as of now Alusus provide low level procedural programming features.
